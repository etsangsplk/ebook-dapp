## Other Platforms

With a specifc focus of being able to build web-based apps ontop of the platform, we've selected the given said of platforms as primary targets to do the tests on. That said, there are others we'd like to have briefly discussed and mentioned why they aren't included (at this point in time).

### [Enigma](https://www.enigma.co/)

Enigma is very interesting project, that promises privacy-first distributed computation. They achieve this with an off-blockchain network that uses the same kadmelia routing system to compute designate responsibility. However, other than many existing platforms, the Enigma system provides a strict distinction between public and private information and computation and ensure the later only happens in chunks that are useless and don't leak any information onto the system they are run on.

While the system is very interesting and highly promising, Enigma has only been described in a Whitepaper yet and as such still misses any publicly known implementation of it. Hence the reason we did not include it. 

### [Tahoe-LAFS](https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs)

Tahoe LAFS is a long-term running, operational and very interesting idea. In its core it consists of two parts: client-side encryption of all data and redundant storage. The project has been around for over a decade and offers their service successfully for quite a while. However, for the purpose of this DApp idea, it is still a client-server-model that is neither actually distributed nor peer-to-peer. If you are a looking for a secure back-up in the cloud, however, this might be a very good choice!

### [ZeroNet](https://zeronet.io/)

### [Storj](https://storj.io/)

StorJ is another recent addition to the world of decentralized network service. It's main focus is to create a competition to for cloud storage services like Dropbox or Amazon that is using peer-to-peer storage instead. It, too, has an incentive system that allows you to "rent out" your own storage to the network and have others pay for using it. And while it is also using many of the underlying technologies as the other frameworks, as it specializes on (file-based) data storage, it doesn't really allow DApps: as of today it has no way to publish or browse public content or apps - everything is encrypted with the users credentials. Making it unapplicable for our use cases.
