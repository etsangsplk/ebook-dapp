# Terminology

Before we can talk about and how to structure and build DApps, we first have to define a few terms, first and foremost what actually consistutes as an DApp.

## Decentral vs Distributed

Depending on who you ask, the "D" in DApp stands for Decentrali\(s\|z\)ed or Distributed Application. And while the distinction between the two matter, for the purpose of this book we'll take a very narrow definition in which we can and will use the terms interchangably.

By itself decentralisation is really just expressing that there is no central authority or single point of failure, something that distribution kinda of implies. However, also any federated network is a decentralised one and that is not what we mean in this context. In a federated system you'd have many servers that clients interact with and that then interact between one another. A good example of a federated application is email or the XMMP jabber service. However, in its traditional usage, the word "distributed" also doesn't entirely express what we are talking about: it comes from control networks, like distributing information accross a controlled database cluster through sharding. In most of these scenarios, while the data might be "distributed" it is usually still under the control of one organisation. For example, Gmail's backend is distributed.  


For the purpose of this book, neither of them are considered DApps. When we talk about distribution and decentralisation we mean **public peer-to-peer-networks**, that everyone can join, participate in and with the, more or less, equal powers and responsibilities as any other party.
